🌊 YOLO-MES
An Effective Lightweight Underwater Garbage Detection Scheme for Marine Ecosystems

YOLO-MES is a lightweight deep learning–based underwater garbage detection framework designed for real-time marine debris monitoring in resource-constrained environments such as underwater robots, AUVs, and IoT-enabled marine systems.
The model is built upon YOLOv10n and enhanced with marine-environment-specific optimizations to improve detection accuracy, robustness, and efficiency in underwater conditions.

📌 Overview

Marine pollution is a major threat to aquatic ecosystems and the blue economy. Detecting underwater debris is challenging due to:

Light absorption and scattering

Low contrast and color distortion

Complex backgrounds (sand, rocks, flora)

Limited computational resources on underwater devices

YOLO-MES addresses these challenges by integrating lightweight architectural enhancements and marine-specific training strategies into a real-time detection pipeline.
